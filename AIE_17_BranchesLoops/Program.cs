            //The % operator gives you the remainder of a division operation.
            //The if statement gives you the condition to see if a number should be part of the sum.
            //The for loop can help you repeat a series of steps for all the numbers 1 through 20.
            //Try it yourself.Then check how you did.As a hint, you should get 63 for an answer.
